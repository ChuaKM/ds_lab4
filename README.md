# ds_lab_4

Objective of this lab was to compare the efficiency of Heap sort and Shell sort. This consisted of four main steps:
- Generate ascending, descending, and random test files of varying sizes. (created a basic python script)
- Create heap sort and shell sort algorithms
- Iterate through each input file, compare the runtimes of both algorithms
- Aggregate results into a cogent format
